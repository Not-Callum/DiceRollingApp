This is a very simple dice rolling app, following a tutorial from Shaun Halverson (link here:[ ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lFSQApxq4g&list=PLyf3HIc5hqTPsZRWyFpi8w58rRxJF5tfp)). I added the text telling the user the total from the die, but other than that it's
just a learning/revision experience, looks swanky though!

Next up, I'm thinking of creating pong.
